Repo for Chris Kilkes' Week 5 / Module 5 Matplotlib / Pandas challenge - Chris Kilkes 3/11/24 @ 11:06 am PST What the project does: Pymaceuticals Analysis provides medical researchers and other stakeholders with an in-depth analysis of the clinical results of various drugs and their impacts on test subjects (i.e. mice) especially around tumor volume and mouse weight. Why the project is useful: Begins building a picture of drug regimen performance and its medical impacts. Additional studies can be conducted using this data on other drug regimens beyond Capomulin (a key focus of this study) and with additional data, not otherwise included, can potentially create a causal relationsip between drug treatments and test subject health. How users can get started with the project: Download, run analysis and evaluate results for self. Resources used for building Pandas project include multiple sources such as: Official Pandas / Python / Matplotlib documentation; instructor teaching (classes & shared resources), aid from fellow students, Google Search, StackOverflow, as well as support and guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT.
